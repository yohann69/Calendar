### 🚩 Known Issues :

- Days without events don't have the detailed date (ex: 04/10/2022 is missing under the dayname)
- On mobile when you select another week, it will display the actual day instead of Monday (ex: you are Tuesday, if you select another week it will display the Tuesday day of the selected week instead of Monday)
- The responsive part of the code is a complete mess (as well as some other parts)

<br />

### 📜 Tout Doux :
- Add a settings option to allow the user to choose what information it want's to display on the events (Teacher name or not, schedules or not...)
